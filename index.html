            <p>This is a project for exchanging stories from Californians on the state's far geographical extremes. Instead of reading <i>about</i> people, let's hear from people themselves.</p>
            <p>Anyone can call <b>(530) 212 6073</b> and listen to a randomly selected message. If you live near the Northern or Southern edge of California - leave a message for others to hear!</p>

For this reason and others, I call this area the un-California California. When you come into this area, it's like stepping back to a time when technology wasn't such a predominant force in our lives."</i></p>
