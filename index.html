            <p>This is a project for exchanging stories from Californians on the state's far geographical extremes. Instead of reading <i>about</i> people, let's hear from people themselves.</p>
            <p>Anyone can call <b>(530) 212 6073</b> and listen to a randomly selected message. If you live near the Northern or Southern edge of California - leave a message for others to hear!</p>

                <span class="quotation-mark">❛</span> I moved to Mt. Shasta about three and a half years ago, which is in Siskiyou County. I was immediately struck by the slower pace of life. For this reason and others, I call this area the un-California California. When coming to the area, it’s like stepping back to an era when technology wasn’t such a predominent force in our lives.

                <span class="quotation-mark">❛</span> We are a land of opportunity. And we are also a land that is endangered itself. There’s still a lot of building going on and that reduces the amount of habitat for our plants and animals. So we have our problems and we have our joys.

                <span class="quotation-mark">❛</span> We’re very rural. We’re right on the ocean. But we have redwood trees all around us, some of the largest trees in the world. We are often cut off from the rest of civilization because our roads slide out. We’ve been cut off for weeks at a time. Often, airplanes can’t get in due to the fog and the rain.
